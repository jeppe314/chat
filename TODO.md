Add Fire logo next to title

Make responsive (hamburger menu for tablet and smaller)

Add loading screen after login / register (chat renders before img has loaded, i.e.)

NEXT: Search function sidebar

Better looking speechbubbles
Search results animation

gradient for login and register page: linear-gradient(20deg, rgb(0, 0, 0) 20%, rgb(35, 34, 37) 68%)
Try also radial gradient with center (lighter) on title?

TODO in future: Implement Algolia for better search function
